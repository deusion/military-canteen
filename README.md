Military Canteens are established anywhere the Army Cadets are stationed. The canteen allows cadets to purchase their day to day paraphernalia at a leisure from their respective canteens. There is a monthly allowance given by the Army for the cadets to spend money on, besides their food. The allowance is given in the form of a slip or a pass which they have to present to the counter and be able to check if they have spent their tokens or not. This system focuses on Ex-Servicemen and the checking of their monthly capability of buying items from the canteen.
